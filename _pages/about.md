I am Jingcheng Shi, a senior undergraduate student majoring in bioinformatics in the School of Life Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU). I am currently preparing for my master's and PhD applications in the fields of computational neuroscience and cognitive science.

I have been involved in a wide range of research related to neuroscience. I have participated in exploring the effects of conditional knockout of LHPP depression candidate gene on phosphorylation signaling pathway. Also, I have explored the electrophysiological mechanisms of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PPN) in a model of Parkinson's pathology(PD) mouse model using the technique of In vivo Single-unit Recording. 

I am also interested in the integration of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, and have been involved in building a classification model of neuropeptide segments based on word2vec and recurrent neural network. 

Currently I am working with \href{https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/}{Songting Li} at Institute of Natural Sciences, SJTU on research with a focus on modeling of working memory through recurrent neural network. The intention of our work is to explore possible context-dependent effects in working memory and also discover potential causes of serial position effect(recency effect, primacy effect).
