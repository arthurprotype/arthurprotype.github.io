I am Jingcheng Shi, a senior undergraduate student majoring in bioinformatics in the School of Life Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am currently preparing for my master's and PhD applications in the fields of computational neuroscience and cognitive science.

I have been involved in a wide range of research related to neuroscience. I have participated in exploring the effects of conditional knockout of LHPP depression candidate gene on phosphorylation signaling pathway, and I have also explored the electrophysiological mechanisms of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PPN) in a model of Parkinson's pathology by recording neural activities in mouse brain. I am also interested in the integration of artificial intelligence and brain science, and have been involved in building a classification model of neuropeptide segments based on word2vec and recurrent neural networks. Currently I am working with Songting Li at Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiaotong University on research related to computational neuroscience, with a focus on modeling of working memory by recurrent neural networks.
