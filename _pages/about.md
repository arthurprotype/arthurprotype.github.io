I am Jingcheng Shi, a senior undergraduate student majoring in bioinformatics in the School of Life Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU). I am currently preparing for my master's and PhD applications in the fields of computational neuroscience and cognitive science.

I have been involved in a wide range of research related to neuroscience. I have participated in exploring the effects of conditional knockout of LHPP depression candidate gene on phosphorylation signaling pathway, and also explored the electrophysiological mechanisms of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus(PPN) in a model of Parkinson's pathology by recording neural activities in mouse brain. 

I am also interested in the integration of artificial intelligence and brain science, and have been involved in building a classification model of neuropeptide segments based on word2vec and recurrent neural networks. 

Currently I am working with \href{https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/}{Songting Li} at Institute of Natural Sciences, SJTU on research related to computational neuroscience, with a focus on modeling of working memory by recurrent neural networks, the intention of our work is to explore possible context-dependent effects in working memory and also discover potential causes of serial position effect(recency effect, primacy effect).
