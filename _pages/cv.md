Research experience
======
* Study of Working Memory Mechanisms Based on Recurrent Neural Network Sept.2021 -- Present
  * Project leader, instructed by [Songting Li](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/) from Institute of Natural Sciences, SJTU  
  Expected work:
  * Build a model to explain working memory storage mechanisms through recurrent neural network
  * Explore possible context-dependent effects in working memory model by adding contextual information to the input and retrieval phases 
  * Discover potential causes of recency effect and primacy effect in working memory model
  
* Establishment of Neuropeptide Classification Model Based on Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Deep Learning Dec.2020 – Sept.2021
  * Research Assistant, instructed by [Yi Xiong](https://xbioinfo.sjtu.edu.cn/index-en.php) from Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, SJTU
  * Constructed a novel neuropeptide prediction model combining NLP with deep learning and achieved classification accuracy of 86.70\%, 4-9\% higher than traditional models
  * Compared prediction effects of different combination of recurrent neural networks(SingleRNN, GRU, LSTM) and word2vec(CBOW, Skip-gram) algorithms 
  
* The Characteristic of Pedunculopontine nucleus(PPN) Neuronal Activity in MPTP-Induced (Parkinson's Disease)PD Mouse Model Oct.2020 – Sept.2021
  * Project leader, instructed by [Fujun Chen](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/FujunChen) from Bio-X Institutes, SJTU
  * Obtained clear spikes of PPN in MPTP-induced PD mice and sham-operated mice using the technique of In vivo Single-unit Recording
  * Analysed characteristics of firing frequency and half-wave width of 70 neurons, 2 different types in the obtained electrical signal recordings through Spike Sorting

* Function Analysis of LHPP, a Candidate Gene for Schizophrenia, on Phosphorylation Signaling Pathway Sept.2019 – Nov.2020
  * Research Assistant, instructed by [Weidong Li](https://lwdlab.sjtu.edu.cn/) from Bio-X Institutes, SJTU
  * Verified the ideality of an animal depression model by behavioral experiments of Sucrose Preference Test(SPT) and Forced Swimming Test(FST)
  * Discovered the change of phosphorylation level of signal molecules in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway according to results of Western Blot
