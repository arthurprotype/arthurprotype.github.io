Research experience
======
* __Working Memory Mechanisms Based on Recurrent Neural Networks__  Sept. 2021 -- Present
  * __Project leader__, instructed by [Songting Li](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/) from Institute of Natural Sciences, SJTU  
  _Expected work:_
  * Model neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explain working memory storage mechanisms through recurrent neural networks
  * Explore possible context-dependent effects in a working memory model by adding contextual information to the input and retrieval phases 
  * Discover potential causes of recency effect and primacy effect in working memory model
  
* __Establishment of Neuropeptide Classification Model Based on Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Deep Learning__  Dec. 2020 – Sept. 2021
  * __Research Assistant__, instructed by [Yi Xiong](https://xbioinfo.sjtu.edu.cn/index-en.php) from Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, SJTU
  * Constructed a novel neuropeptide prediction model combining NLP with deep learning and improved the classification accuracy, 4-9% higher than traditional models
  * Compared prediction effects of 3×2 combination of recurrent neural networks (Vanilla RNN, GRU, LSTM) and word2vec (CBOW, Skip-gram) algorithms
  
* __Analysis of Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) Neuronal Activity Characteristics in MPTP-Induced Parkinson’s Disease (PD) Mouse Model__  Oct. 2020 – Sept. 2021
  * __Project leader__, instructed by [Fujun Chen](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/En/FujunChen) from Bio-X Institutes, SJTU
  * Obtained clear spikes from PPN in MPTP-induced PD mice and sham-operated mice using the technique of In vivo Single-unit Recording
  * Analysed characteristics of firing frequency and half-wave width of 70 neurons and obtained 2 types of neurons in the electrical signal recordings through Spike Sorting

* __Function Analysis of LHPP, a Candidate Gene for Schizophrenia, on Phosphorylation Signaling Pathway__  Sept. 2019 – Nov. 2020
  * __Research Assistant__, instructed by [Weidong Li](https://lwdlab.sjtu.edu.cn/) from Bio-X Institutes, SJTU
  * Verified the ideality of an animal depression model by Sucrose Preference Test(SPT) and Forced Swimming Test(FST)
  * Discovered the change of phosphorylation level of signal molecules on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway according to results of Western Blot
